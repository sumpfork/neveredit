Credits:
    Thank you to Damon Law (damondesign.com) and Sylvan_Elf for the 
    neveredit icons and splash screen, respectively.

    Full credit should go to Torlack (torlack.com) for his great
    documentation on the mdl binary file format, and his nss script
    compiler (now maintained bythe openknights for linux and mac)
    that is used in neveredit.

    Neveredit contains some code from OpenGLContext (mainly the quaternion
    implementation), pyopengl.sf.net.

    I am now including the NWN Lexicon from http://nwnlexicon.com in
    the neveredit help. Thanks to all the contributors for putting together
    that great resource.

Installation:
        If you have the Mac dmg distribution: drag the application to your
        applications folder. Double-click it there.

        If you have the Linux binary distribution: run 'neveredit' or 'neverscript'
        in the untarred/unzipped package (whichever one you downloaded).

        If you have the source distribution: you will need to install the
        requirements under 'Requirements' below. Then you have a choice:
        1) execute run/neveredit, run/neverscript or run/nevercommand to run directly
                from the source
        2) do a 'python setup.py install --home=<somedir>' where <somedir>
                is where you'd like neveredit to install. The executables will be
                under 'bin' in that dir.
        3) do a 'python setup.py install' with root priviliges, and neveredit
                will be install into your system-wide python tree, together with
                the main scripts. Make sure your python bin dir is on your PATH.

        If you do 1) or 2), neveredit needs to do some funky python path manipulation
        to figure out where the package is relative to its script. Thus, 3) is
        certainly the preferred method. Remember, no guarantees.

Requirements:

        If you downloaded the Mac dmg distribution that contains a
        neveredit application there should be NO EXTRA REQUIREMENTS
        on Mac OS X 10.3. Just double-click the app.

        If you downloaded the linux binary distribution, there should
        also be NO EXTRA REQUIREMENTS. Simply cd to the archive you
        untared and run './neveredit'. I cannot guarantee that
        this distribution works on any but the distro I build on,
        which currently is Fedora Core 3.

        Sorry, I have stopped supporting OS X 10.2 in the dmg dist as of
        neveredit 0.6b1 as it was sucking up too much of my time. 
        You should still be able to run from source under 10.2 
        if you install the packages below.


        Requirements for the source (tar.gz dist):
        Try the instructions for getting all these dependencies at
        http://openknights.sourceforge.net/tikiwiki/tiki-index.php?page=NeverEditMacInstallFromSource
        (thanks to Alan Schmitt)
        For Mac OS X, check out http://undefined.org/python/packages.html where
        you can find installers for all of the requirements except PyOpenGL and wxPython.

        All Platforms:
        Python 2.3 (this comes with Mac OS X 10.3. Get the framework
                    MacPython build if you're on 10.2)
                    http://www.python.org

        PyOpenGL http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net/ 2.0.1.07
                 note that there are problems with earlier versions!

        PIL (the python imaging library), 
                 http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/

        numarray, http://www.stsci.edu/resources/software_hardware/numarray

        wxPython, http://wxpython.org/download.php#binaries
                  neveredit requires a version number greater than 2.5, and
                  greater than 2.5.3 is recommended
        
        NWNTools, http://openknights.sf.net
                To compile scripts you need to compile and install the
                source version (right now the one in CVS) of Torlack's 
                tools, now maintained by me.
                Basically, follow the install instructions with those
                tools and then cd to nwnnsscomp/python and do a
                'python setup.py install'

        --------------

        Gentoo hint: I got the following hint from a Gentoo user, saying
               that this will install all the dependencies for neveredit 0.6:
               'emerge pyopengl wxpython Imaging numarray'

        Mac extras: For the source (tar.gz) version, Mac OS X requires
               wxPython and a framework build of python 
               (you need to install both of these on 
               Jaguar, but only wxPython on Panther) If you are
               running from source, you can get all of the
               additional needed libraries listed here as binary installs 
               by pointing the python package manager app to bob
               ipollito's repository, linked off
               http://undefined.org/python/pimp/

    To run from source, do something like 'python NeverEditMainApp.py', 
    or if that doesn't work and you're on a Mac try 
    'pythonw NeverEditMainApp.py'.


Instructions:
    So far, just a short note: I'm trying to emulate the camera controls
    in NWN in the map display, so try using up/down/left/right arrows
    as well as q,w,e,s.

Context:
    Welcome to neveredit. Neveredit strives to be an editor for files from 
    Bioware's game Neverwinter Nights. One day it may have all of the 
    functionality of Bioware's windows tools, and maybe more. For now, 
    I am striving to achieve basic editing functionality on non-Windows 
    platforms. This means that this is alpha quality software, and will 
    at the current stage likely do bad things to your files. I'm happy 
    to receive bug reports, but take no responsibility for any 
    damages incurred through the use of this software.

    I write neveredit as part of the
    Openknights Consortium (http://sf.net/projects/openknights)
    a group of people dedicated to bringing a toolset for NWN to
    the Mac and to Linux (and maybe back to Windows). Please file any 
    bug reports on our sourceforge site.
    
    This is an application written in Python (http://python.org) 
    and wxPython (http://wxpython.org).

    Have fun, sumpfork
