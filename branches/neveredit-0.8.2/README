Credits:
    Alan Schmitt has been contributing a good chunk of code, especially
    the beginnings of a conversation editor.

    Thank you to Damon Law (damondesign.com) and Sylvan_Elf for the 
    neveredit icons and splash screen, respectively.

    Full credit should go to Torlack (torlack.com) for his great
    documentation on the mdl binary file format, and his nss script
    compiler (now maintained bythe openknights for linux and mac)
    that is used in neveredit.

    Neveredit contains some code from OpenGLContext (mainly the quaternion
    implementation), pyopengl.sf.net.

    I am now including the NWN Lexicon from http://nwnlexicon.com in
    the neveredit help. Thanks to all the contributors for putting together
    that great resource.

Installation:
        If you have the Mac dmg distribution: drag the application to your
        applications folder. Double-click it there.

        If you have the Linux binary distribution: run 'neveredit' or 
        'neverscript' in the untarred/unzipped package 
       (whichever one you downloaded).

        If you're trying to run neveredit on another platform, or want
        to run neveredit from source for some other reason, or if the
        packaged version doesn't work for you at all:
        Check 
        http://neveredit.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/moin.cgi/RunningNevereditFromSource
        for instructions as to how to satisfy the dependencies for running
        neveredit from source.

Instructions:
    So far, just a short note: I'm trying to emulate the camera controls
    in NWN in the map display, so try using up/down/left/right arrows
    as well as q,w,e,s.
