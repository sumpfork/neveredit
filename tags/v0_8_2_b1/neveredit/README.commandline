neveredit now includes a command line tool for nwn resource listing and extraction.

Assuming the file is executable (otherwise make it so), run it as
./nevercommand lookup <extension1> [<extension2> <extension3}...]
./nevercommand print <resourcekey>
./nevercommand get <resourcekey>
./nevercommand strref <strref>
./nevercommand extract <ERF file>

The first version prints all known resource keys with a given extension.
The second version loads a resource and prints in a human readable format
The third version retrieves the raw bytes of a resource.
The fourth version gets a string from dialog.tlk (accepts either hex strrefs such as '0x13'
                                                  or non-hex such as '13')
The fifth version dumps the entries of an ERF file to the current working dir

Possible options are
[-d|--dir]NWNDir specify where you copy of NWN is installed.
[-m|--module]module load a module to access its resources
[-o|--outfile]outfile output to this file instead of stdout

Examples:
./nevercommand lookup NSS 
 - looks up the names of all uncompiled scripts in your NWN install
./nevercommand -m coc/coc.mod print module.ifo
 - prints the contents of the 'module.ifo' resource in the 'coc.mod' module
./nevercommand -o script.nss get nw_d2_gwiz02.nss
 - stores the named script from your NWN install in a file called 'script.nss'
